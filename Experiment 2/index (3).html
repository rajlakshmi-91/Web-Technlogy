  <p>Importance of yoga in <b>students life</b> can really be a game changer for a student. It is difficult for a student to stay motivated throughout, pertaining to the ups and downs in the result. Yoga is the <strong>union of physical, mental and spiritual aspects of the body</strong>. It originated in ancient India and it consists of combining physical postures with breathing techniques with the help of <b>meditation</b> and hence relaxation. According to ancient Indian texts, Yoga can open up all the senses of your body and keep you <b>healthy and fit</b>.</p>

 <p>A student is always on his toes managing his studies with his social life. It is imperative for him to match the pace of the ever-growing world. A day off would surely pile up a lot of works including studies and assignments. And in a hectic schedule, it is difficult to take out time for completing the pending work. So a student first needs to be <b>healthy</b> so that he does not miss a day. The <strong>importance of yoga in student’s life</strong> kicks in here. Yoga consists of basic stretching exercises combined with breathing and meditation; hence yoga helps you to cleanse your body <strong>physically and spiritually</strong>.</p>

<p>A student who practices yoga regularly is bound to have a profound effect on his health and academics. According to ancient Indian texts, there have been sages in the history who used to practice yoga regularly. These sages attained a great sense of spirituality and a full control of conscience. They attained unparalleled concentration power and that is the first desirable importance of yoga in student’s life.</p>

  <p>With increased <b>concentration</b>, a student can complete a task earlier as compared to an average student. The other importance of yoga in student’s life is that yoga provides <strong>self-determination and self-motivation</strong>. This is a highly desirable trait in students as a student needs to be <b>motivated and determined</b> as he has a long journey to continue.</p>

 <p>Yoga also helps to <b>boost memory</b> through meditation. It is widely accepted as a better exercise than brain training. Yoga also imbibes a good posture if done regularly. A good posture is necessary for every human being in the long run. We hear cases of Spondylitis from the millennial generation which is highly unacceptable. The students have to spend their precious time and money on <b>physiotherapy</b>. If you practice yoga regularly, you won’t ever have to go to a doctor for diseases and other disorders.</p>

<p>Even though students feel they have no spare time for exercise, they should consider taking at least 30 minutes 3 times a week to go to gym, participate in a Zumba class, try a swim session, do some weight lifting, or in any other physical activities they enjoy. With regular exercise, you'll feel less stress, more energised, have improved memory and cognitive performance, plus you'll stay fit and toned.</p>

  <h1>The Power Of Yoga In School</h1>
  <p>
  The whole cycle of running to school , pressure from parents and teachers , comparison , social anxiety has led to stress among students . Social media has taken away the joy of outdoor playing and lack of physical activity among students is a major concern . The following points highlight the necessity of yoga in a student’s life .
  <p>

  <p>From first graders to college seniors, students may have youth on their side — but that doesn't mean their lives are <b>pressure-free</b>. Hours a day sitting at desk or computer monitor and more hours doing homework cause a young body to tense up. Social and family pressures and, unfortunately, anxiety, abuse and bullying also take their toll. It all adds up to the same high stress levels that have caused the grown-up world to flock to yoga classes to find Zen.Stress is a major obstacle to academic achievement, and yoga's stress relief powers have been shown to boost student performance. After around seven weeks of practicing asanas, breathing exercises and meditation, the students registered lower stress levels and higher academic performance. Yoga has been shown to improve memory in both adults and children, a benefit that would seem certain to improve academic performance. Controlling attention is a challenge for children, partly because the brain's frontal lobes, which control the power of attention, mature later than some other functions. Yoga requires attention, which can be a challenge for younger yogis, but it has also been found to enhance the ability to control attention, even in hyperactive children.

  <aside >
    <h1>What is the meaning of yoga?</h1>
    <p>A Hindu spiritual and ascetic discipline, a part of which, including breath control, simple meditation, and the adoption of specific bodily postures, is widely practised for health and relaxation.</p>
    <h1>Why is yoga important?</h1>
    <p>We don’t practice yoga by jumping on a mat or going to a yoga class. It’s what we do on the mat, or in the class that matters.<b> We do yoga when we connect with the process of acting and paying attention.</b> It is a back-and-forth activity where one drives the other and vice-versa.
