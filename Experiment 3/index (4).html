		</br>

		<dt>Agni IV<dt>
			<dd>Agni-IV ("Fire") is the fourth in the Agni series of missiles which was earlier known as Agni II prime. It has been developed by India's DRDO and displayed a number of new technologies and significant improvement in missile technology.</dd>
		</br>

		<dt>Agni-III<dt>
			<dd>The Agni-III (IAST: Agni "Fire", the Vedic fire god in Hinduism) is an Indian intermediate-range ballistic missile inducted into service in 2011 as the successor of the Agni-II. It has a range of 3,000 to 5,000 kilometres (1,900 to 3,100 mi) and can reach targets deep inside neighbouring countries including China.</dd>
		</br>

		<dt>Agni-II<dt>
			<dd>This missile has a theoretical maximum range of some 3,000 km with a 1,000 kg payload (conventional or strategic). Tested to range of over 2,000 km, the Agni-II has an all-solid propellant system.</dd>
		</br>

		<dt>Agni-I<dt>
				<dd>Agni-I is a short-range ballistic missile that was developed by DRDO of India in the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program. It is a single-stage missile that was developed after the Kargil War to fill the gap between the 250 km range of the Prithvi-II missile and the 2,500 km range of the Agni-II.</dd>
			</br>

		<dt>Nirbhay<dt>
			<dd>Nirbhay (Hindi:Dauntless/Fearless) is a long range, all-weather, subsonic cruise missile designed and developed in India by the Aeronautical Development Establishment which is under Defence Research and Development Organisation. The missile can be launched from multiple platforms and is capable of carrying conventional and nuclear warheads.</dd>
		</br>

		<dt>Prithvi II<dt>
			<dd>Prithvi II class is also a single-stage liquid-fueled missile having a maximum warhead mounting capability of 500 kg, but with an extended range of 250 km (160 mi). It was developed with the Indian Air Force being the primary user. It was first test-fired on 27 January 1996 and the development stages were completed in 2004. This variant has been inducted into the army as well. In a test, the missile was launched with an extended range of 350 km (220 mi) and had improved navigation due to an inertial navigation system. The missile features measures to deceive anti-ballistic missiles.</dd>
		</br>

		<dt>Prithvi I<dt>
			<dd>Prithvi I class is a single-stage liquid-fueled surface-to-surface ballistic missile having a maximum warhead mounting capability of 1,000 kg, with a range of 150 km (93 mi). It has an accuracy of 10–50 m (33–164 ft) and can be launched from transporter erector launchers. This class of Prithvi missile was inducted into the Indian Army in 1994. As Per (DRDO) Chief Avinash Chander the tactical 150 km-range Prithvi missile will be replaced with the Prahaar missile, which is more capable and has more accuracy. According to Chander, the Prithvi I missiles withdrawn from service would be upgraded to be used for longer ranges</dd>
		</br>

		<dt>Prahaar<dt>
			<dd>Prahaar is an Indian solid-fuel road-mobile tactical ballistic missile developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation. Prahaar is expected to replace the Prithvi-I short-range ballistic missile in Indian service.</dd>
